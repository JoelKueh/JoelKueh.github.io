					<h2>
						About Me
					</h2>
					<p>
					I'm a student who's currently attending the University of Minnesota Twin Cities to get my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.
					Ever since my first day in robotics, I knew that I had a passion for programming. It is my goal to
					take that passion and turn it into a carrer.
					</p>
					<p>
					As far as languages go, I've done most of my work in C++, but I am also familiar with C# .NET and Python. I've also dabbled with
					a little bit of web development in PHP, HTML, and JavaScript that I used at my job at The Next Step.

						Projects
					</h2>
					<p>
					As I said before, programming is both my passion and my hobby. As a result, I have gained a wide variety of different experiences through various personal projects that I have done. 
					You can read more about my personal projects in the entries below.

						<h3>
							JChessV2
						</h3>
						<p>
						JChessV2 is a C++ remake of a Chess game I made in C# called JChess. The project was designed to be the base of a Chess AI that I will start writing soon.
						As a chess AI needs to look through hundreds of millions of positions every time it makes a decision. I worked very hard to make sure that move generation
						would be as fast as possible. The move generation algorighms make use of lookup tables and bithacks to efficiently generate moves. After multiple iterations
						and hous upon hours of reading move generation theory on <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/">ChessProgramming.org</a>, I managed to search through
						chess positions at 43 million nodes per second on a single thread.
						</p>
						<p>
						Currently, the game can only be played through a terminal UI, but I'm leanrning the OpenGL api to add an optional GUI as well. I'm also working with a couple
						of friends to add networking to the game so that users can play online rather than just locally. Eventually, my friends and I will move on to writing the AI
						itself, but that can't come without a decent ammount of prep work and a lot more reading. You can take a look at what we've got so far on my github in
						the link on the right.

						<h3>
							Mandelbrot Set
						</h3>
						<p>
						In the spring of my senior year of high school, I really took an interest in the Mandelbrot Set. If you haven't heard of it, it's a fractal produced by a
						relatively simple recursive algorithm. If the algorithm converges for a given point on the complex plane, then you plot a black point, if the algorighm
						diverges for a given point, you plot a white point (in reality, most people plot a color based on the number of iterations it took for the result to reach
						some escape radius). The set of all points where the algorithm converges is the Mandelbrot Set.
						</p>
						<p>
						As this algorithm has to once on every pixel on the screen individually. I thought it would be interesting to learn how pass this computation off to the GPU
						for efficiency. As a result, I decided to write this program with the DirectX API. At the moment, this program just renders one frame of the Mandelbrot Set.
						You can't interact with it, or zoom in to different sections of it. I have plans to add to this program and fix this in the future.

							Project JEL
						</h3>
						<p>
						Project JEL is a fanmade pokemon game that I'm writing for fun with a couple of my friends. We're currently using GameMakerStudio as our engine.
						I act as the backend developer and GitHub maintainer, so I had to learn a lot about resolving merge conflicts and other best-practices for Git.
						</p>
						<p>
						The project seems pretty simple on the surface, but there were a couple of interesting problems that I had to solve that involved writing a server
						in node.js that acts as a middle man to a text-stream based battle server as well as a C++ .dll that allows GameMaker to communicate with it.
						Overall, the project has been a lot of fun to make.

							University Kernel Object (U.ko)
						</h3>
						<p>
						Since Fall 2022, I've been working with a group called the University Kernel Object. In essence, we are a group of UMNTC students who are really passionate
						about the Linux Kernel. Led by a couple of University Professors as well as a Kernel maintainer, we have been exploring different aspects of the Linux Kernel and learning
						about Kernel development.
						</p>
						<p>
						In particular, I have been involved with the Virtual Memory Subgroup. Over the spring of 2023, we searched through kernel source code to learn how virtual memory
						was implemented in the kernel. In the end, we wrote a program which could map the virtual address space of a running program to its physical counterpart.

							First Robotics Competition (Tobor 2143)

						<p>
						First Robotics Competition (FRC) was the first thing that got me into programming. It helped me develop a passion for programming and taught
						me a lot of what I know today. For this reason, I like to give back some of my time throughout the year to help other kids enjoy it as much as I did.
						Robotics was one of my favorite parts of high school, so I'm thankful that I have gotten to stay active in it as a programming mentor for my old team.
