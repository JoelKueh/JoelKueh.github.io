					<h2>
						About Me
					</h2>
					<p>
					I'm a student who's currently attending the University of Minnesota Twin Cities to get my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.
					Ever since my first day in robotics, I knew that I had a passion for programming. It is my goal to
					take that passion and turn it into a carrer.
					</p>
					<p>
					As far as languages go, I've done most of my work in C++, but I am also familiar with C# .NET. I've also dabbled with
					a little bit of web development in PHP, HTML, and JavaScript that I used at my job at The Next Stepassets.

							University Kernel Object (U.ko)

						<p>
						Since Fall 2022, I've been working with a group called the University Kernel Object. In essence, we are a group of UMNTC students who are really passionate
						about the Linux Kernel. Led by a couple of University Professors as well as a Kernel maintainer, we have been exploring different aspects of the Linux Kernel and learning
						about Kernel development. You can read more about us in the links on the right.

							First Robotics Competition (Tobor 2143)
						</h3>
						<p>
						First Robotics Competition (FRC) was the first thing that got me into programming. It helped me develop a passion for programming and taught
						me a lot of what I know today. For this reason, I like to give back some of my time throughout the year to help other kids enjoy it as much as I did.
						Robotics was one of my favorite parts of high school, so I'm thankful that I have gotten to stay active in it as a programming mentor for my old team.
